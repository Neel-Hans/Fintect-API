# Fintech Dashboard API

A backend API for a finance dashboard system built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite/PgSql.


---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** SQLite (local), PostgreSQL (production)
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication:** JWT via python-jose
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt via passlib
- **Validation:** Pydantic v2

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd fintech_project

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux

3. **Install dependencies**
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Create `.env` file**
   cp .env.example .env

   Fill in the values:
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./fintech.db
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60

5. **Run the server**
   uvicorn main:app --reload


Tables and seed data are created automatically on startup using FastAPI lifespan

## Default Admin Credentials

email: neel.hans97@gmail.com
password: admin123

The admin credentials are currently hardcoded for faster development in production it will be handled through env variable.
The admin has the power to promote and demote. 
The default role assigned to users on registration is viewer. They can be later promoted by the admin
to Analyst, or Admin. 

As a safety measure the admin cannot demote themselves.

## Analyst


## Viewer

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, visit:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Click **Authorize** and login with the admin credentials to test protected endpoints.

## Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| Admin | Full access — manage users, records, dashboard |
| Analyst | View records and dashboard summaries |
| Viewer | View dashboard data only |

The roles are handled by enums to

## Assumptions

- Financial records represent company customer data, not tied to individual users
- Users represent internal company staff with different access levels
- Soft delete is used for financial records — deleted records are hidden but not removed from the database
- Admin credentials are seeded automatically on first startup

---

## Tradeoffs
- The admin credential is currently hardcoded in the  seed_admins.py however for production it may be shifted to .env file
- Used os.getenv() for environment variables directly. In production this would be replaced with pydantic BaseSettings for typed config management and validation
- Sync vs Async: Used synchronous SQLAlchemy Session with def routes for simplicity. A production system would benefit from AsyncSession with asyncpg for true async I/O, but that added complexity was out of scope for this assignment.

### Database
- Used **SQLite** locally for simplicity. Switched to **PostgreSQL** on Railway via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with no code changes needed.
- In production, **Alembic** would be used for schema migrations instead of `create_all` on startup.

### Authentication
- Used `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` for the login endpoint as it follows FastAPI's standard auth pattern and works seamlessly with Swagger UI for testing.
- `SECRET_KEY` is stored in `.env`. In production this should be a long random string stored in a secrets manager.

### Async vs Sync
- Used synchronous SQLAlchemy `Session` with `def` routes for simplicity. A production system would benefit from `AsyncSession` with `asyncpg` for true async I/O.

### Configuration
- Used `os.getenv()` for environment variables directly. In production this would be replaced with Pydantic `BaseSettings` for typed config management and validation.

### Pagination
- Pagination is not implemented on list endpoints. In production, limit/offset or cursor based pagination would be added.

### Seed Data
- Tables and seed data are created automatically on startup via FastAPI lifespan. In production, Alembic migrations and a separate deployment step would handle this.
